    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "OGGM-Edu (http://edu.oggm.org) is an educational platform providing instructors with tools that allow the demonstration of the governing principles of glacier behaviour. It offers online interactive apps and Jupyter notebooks that can be run in a browser via MyBinder or JupyterHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how an open source numerical glacier model ([OGGM](http://oggm.org)) can be used to tackle scientific and socially-relevant research questions in class assignments and student projects. It is built on two complementary numerical experiments: \n",
    "1. the first section uses idealized glaciers (with controlled boundary conditions) to illustrate how climate and topography influence glacier behavior, and\n",
    "2. the second section relies on realistic glaciers to illustrate how downstream freshwater resources will be affected by glacier change in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook contains code sections that serve as templates, followed by research questions and suggestions that invite the student to re-run the experiment with updated simulation parameters. This notebook (as well as all other similar notebooks featured on the OGGM-Edu platform) is meant to be adapted by teachers to match the topics of a specific lecture or workshop. OGGM-Edu notebooks can help students to overcome barriers posed by numerical modelling and coding, in a fun, question-driven and societally relevant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- teach a selection of fundamental concepts in glaciology \n",
    "- use and abstraction of a complex numerical model for teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- for details about the numerical model, visit https://docs.oggm.org\n",

    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "OGGM-Edu can be used in workshops and classes. Example applications include a three-day workshop in Peru for university students without prior glacier experience ([repository](https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia), [more info](https://oggm.org/2019/12/06/OGGM-Edu-AGU/)) or the University of Michigan CLaSP 474 [Ice and Climate notebooks](https://github.com/skachuck/clasp474_w2021).\n",

    "## The 10 rules\n",
    "These recommendations are based on [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tell a story for an audience: interleave explanatory text with code and results to create a computational narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document the process, not just the results: so that others, and yourself later, will understand your reasoning and choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use cell divisions to make steps clear: have eaach cell perform one meaningful and documented step, avoid long cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularize code: use and document functions for repeated operations to make the code more readable and save space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Record dependencies: use pip or Conda package manager, with environment.yml (Conda) or requirements.txt (pip). Please indicate package versions explicitly. Ideally, include a listing of dependencies at the bottom of the notebook. Make sure you test your notebook in an environment created from these dependencies, so that you don't add undocumened dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use version control: https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime is a diffing tool specifically designed for notebooks; you may find it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Build a pipeline: place key variable declarations at the top. Test with different parameters, clean up, and run all cells to prepare for potential non-interactive execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Share and explain your data: if the original data are too big, inlude a sample. Make sure that the data is accessible. Include data description, and any processing done beforehand. Ideally, point to datasets that have been permanently managed and identified by DOIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored:  \n",
    "    9.1. Read: store it in a public code repository with a clear README file and a liberal open source license. Generate HTML/PDF versions of the final notebook.  \n",
    "    9.2. Run: use Binder to run it in the cloud, and/or create a Docker image.  \n",
    "    9.3. Explore: use interactive widgets (e.g., ipywidgets, or panel) \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Advocate for open research: ask your colleagues or friends to try to run your notebooks."
